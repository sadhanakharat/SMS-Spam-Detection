An LSTM-based neural network for detecting spam in SMS messages! ðŸš€ This project preprocesses messages, trains a robust model, and accurately predicts whether a message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

âœ… Preprocessing:
- Removes special characters, numbers, and common stopwords while retaining key spam indicators (e.g., "won," "free").

âœ… Model:
- Utilizes an **LSTM network** with embedding layers to understand the context of text messages.

âœ… Dataset Handling:
- Balances data using **SMOTE** to improve spam detection accuracy.

âœ… Evaluation:
- Reports accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to assess model performance.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset should be in CSV format (`train.csv`) with the following structure:

| Column Name | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `sms`       | The text message content                         |
| `label`     | `1` for spam, `0` for non-spam (ham)             |

 **Example Dataset**
CSV
sms,label
"Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card!",1
"Hi, how are you?",0
"Claim your free prize now!",1
"Let's meet up this weekend.",0

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on the following metrics:

| Metric       | Value  |
|--------------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | 95.2%  |
| **Precision**| 92.8%  |
| **Recall**   | 93.5%  |
| **F1-Score** | 93.1%  |

These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in detecting spam, with a good balance between precision and recall.
