An LSTM-based neural network for detecting spam in SMS messages! ðŸš€ This project preprocesses messages, trains a robust model, and accurately predicts whether a message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

âœ… Preprocessing:
- Removes special characters, numbers, and common stopwords while retaining key spam indicators (e.g., "won," "free").

âœ… Model:
- Utilizes an **LSTM network** with embedding layers to understand the context of text messages.

âœ… Dataset Handling:
- Balances data using **SMOTE** to improve spam detection accuracy.

âœ… Evaluation:
- Reports accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to assess model performance.
